# NumPy and Pandas Exercises

This repository contains Python exercises demonstrating the use of NumPy and Pandas libraries for data manipulation and analysis.  The exercises cover creating arrays, reshaping, indexing, working with Pandas Series and DataFrames.

## Exercises

**Exercise 1 :**

Create a NumPy array containing the numbers from 1 to 10, and then reshape it to a 2x5 matrix.

**Exercise 2 :**

Create a NumPy array containing the numbers from 1 to 20, and then extract the elements between the 5th and 15th index (inclusive).

**Exercise 3 :**

Create a Pandas Series with the following data: `{'apples': 3, 'bananas': 2, 'oranges': 1}`. Then, add a new item to the series with the key 'pears' and the value 4.

**Exercise 4 :**

Create a Pandas DataFrame with the following columns: `name`, `age`, and `gender`. The DataFrame should have 10 rows of data.  You can populate the data with any values you like.

**Exercise 5 :**

Add a new column to the DataFrame created in Exercise 4, called `occupation`. The values for this column should be 'Programmer', 'Manager', and 'Analyst', cycling through these values to fill the 10 rows.

**Exercise 6 :**

Select the rows of the DataFrame where the age is greater than or equal to 30.

**Exercise 7 :**

Convert the DataFrame to a CSV file named `data.csv`. Then, read the `data.csv` file back into a Pandas DataFrame and display its contents.

## Files

*   `numpy_pandas_exercises.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the solutions to the exercises.  (Or `numpy_pandas_exercises.py` if you prefer a Python script).
*   `data.csv`: CSV file created and read in Exercise 7. (This will be created when you run the notebook/script).
*   `README.md`: This file, providing a description of the exercises.

## How to Run

1.  Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/[your_username]/[repository_name].git`
2.  Navigate to the directory: `cd [repository_name]`
3.  Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed: `pip install numpy pandas`
4.  Run the Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook numpy_pandas_exercises.ipynb`
